### My works, my experiences, my ideas
NodeJS + ExpressJS + Ideas


This web app doesn't use a database and a CMS. That's why, using the free hosting solution by Heroku, I can't have a database. Although, a lot of data are dynamic, managed by a JSON file, which I'd like to export it on Dropbox for a better use while editing. Instead, in homepage, my picture and short biography are obtained from my Twitter profile using Twitter API.

## UI Design
Each template are made by me, even though I've started from a free bootstrap template. The coolest thing about design is that the homepage slideshow and menu are made by using just CSS:

- The slideshow in homepage uses animation property in CSS, which can be used to animate many other CSS properties. In this case animation changes opacity property for each slide.
- The menu's animation is handled by using just a checkbox and CSS transform properties.

Javascript is just used for tweets slider.
